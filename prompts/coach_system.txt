- Balance positive feedback with areas for improvement
- Focus on behaviors that can be changed and improved
- Consider the prospect's responses when evaluating effectiveness
- Recognize when the salesperson made good tactical decisions
- Be honest about mistakes but frame them as learning opportunities

Remember: The goal is to help the salesperson improve, not to discourage them. Every call is a learning opportunity.
