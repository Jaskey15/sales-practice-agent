    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yeah, I don't want to take too much of your time. Um I just had a quick question for you. How do you guys typically handle your uh customer Communications?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "We're kind of all over the place with it honestly. We use text messages, phone calls, emails, whatever the customer prefers. It works but it's a pain to keep track of everything, especially when multiple people are talking to the same customer. Why do you ask?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "So I work for a company called Red River Automation and we work with small businesses to um help them automate and organize some of the workflows to take some of that stress off of kind of the personal management of those processes. How does that sound to you?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I mean, I'm always interested in making things run smoother around here. But I've gotta be honest, I get a lot of calls from software companies and most of them don't really understand how an auto shop works. What specifically are you talking about when you say automate workflows? Like what would that actually look like for us day to day?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yeah, that's a good question. Let me be a little more descriptive. So actually, these past couple months I've been working with, uh, 3 companies 1 owner. So it's a boat detailing car detailing, and a ceramic coating shop. What I've done is I've set up for them, a lead nurturing personalized chatbot. So each time a customer sells it, a form online, it goes, and I send a personalized message to that customer. And then this this conversation lasts 4 or 5, um, back and forth. So the customer has more info and then I hand off to the sales rep to close the deal, so it's basically help them organize, their initial touch points and bit better qualify. Kind of their quality of leads."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Okay, so you're talking about automating the initial customer contact when someone fills out a form on our website. That's interesting. We do get inquiries through our site, but honestly a lot of our business is repeat customers or word of mouth. How does this help with the chaos of managing existing customers? Like when someone texts me about rescheduling their PPF install or asks a question about their ceramic coating maintenance, that's where we're really drowning. Does your system handle that kind of ongoing communication or is it just for new leads?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "First, let me ask you this. Do you guys use any sort of CRM or is it all just through spreadsheets?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "We don't have a real CRM. We've got customer info in a basic spreadsheet and then everything else is scattered - texts on our phones, emails, some notes written down. The owner keeps saying we need to get something set up but we haven't pulled the trigger on anything yet. It's definitely not ideal, especially when I'm trying to figure out when someone's last service was or what we promised them. Why, does your system include CRM stuff or would we need something separate?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "So we absolutely would not need a CRM and actually I don't really have um a system. So each business I work with I build them a customized solution based on their needs. So with the last business they use the CRM, go. High level and I was able to integrate any everything into their  But if you're just using spreadsheets, I can still take data from calls and scheduling and coordinating and just upload that all to a spreadsheet. So you have access to it. And the beauty is a lot of this can be automated. So let's see if it gets lost to, you know, a busy day or someone forgetting to write something down."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Okay, so you're saying you'd build something custom for us that could pull in data from calls and scheduling automatically into our spreadsheet. That sounds useful, but I'm trying to understand what the actual automation piece is. Like, are you talking about recording our phone calls and pulling info from them? Or automatically updating when we book appointments? And honestly, what's the cost look like for something like this? We're only 12 people, so our budget is pretty tight. I need to understand if this is even in the ballpark before we go too far down this road."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yeah, I'm on the same page there, Sarah and let me uh propose this. So forever. For all my first clients I offer a free uh automation audit of their companies, that's typically a 30 minute phone call where you talk about your biggest concerns pain points. What do you think is most um kind of able to be automated? I'll assess that and what I can actually do on my end and then we can come to a little better agreement. Um what we want to get done. So how does it sound to schedule a time sometime when you have maybe a little more free time for us to dive in a little deeper on this free of charge?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I appreciate that you're not trying to quote me something right now without understanding our business better. A 30 minute call makes sense. But before I put time on the calendar, I need to know ballpark what we're talking about cost-wise if we did move forward. Are we talking a couple hundred bucks a month or a couple thousand? Because if it's way outside our budget, I don't want to waste either of our time. And also, have you actually worked with a shop like ours before? You mentioned boat detailing and ceramic coating, but PPF installation and paint correction are pretty specific. I need to know this isn't going to be a square peg round hole situation."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yeah, so like I said, I did work with ceramic coating and ppf with the other business and even though I didn't know a whole lot at first, you know, I spent the whole first 2 3 weeks, um reading about their services having 1-on ones with team members, um doing my own research on kind of ppf and stream of coding and all this stuff. So I've got a pretty good knowledge on it, um, so far and I plan on continuing to learn. Um, and as far as the costs that really just depends on how far you guys want to go. So that's the beauty. And the discovery call Will assess what, um, is likely for you guys. And then I can give a better estimate but not going to be tens of thousands of dollars, you know, I work with clients of all sizes and sometimes if they just want 1 simple automation, it's easy for me to set up and it may just be a couple hundred bucks a month that you know, freeze up 5 to 10 hours a week for 1 of their employees. So the situation definitely varies which is why we can discuss it over that Discovery call."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Alright, I hear you. A couple hundred bucks a month for something that actually saves us time would be worth it, but yeah, we'd need to figure out what makes sense. Look, I'm open to having that conversation. Our afternoons are usually a bit calmer than mornings. What days work for you next week? I should mention though, depending on what we talk about, I'll probably need to loop in the owner before we commit to anything. He's pretty involved in decisions like this, especially anything that touches money or changes how we operate."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yeah, absolutely Lupin who you need to on that. And um I'll I'll send you uh, a link to my calendar, which has on my availabilities and then you could just um, select whichever 1 works best for you. How does that sound?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That works. Go ahead and send that over. What's the best way to get it to me - email or text?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I'll just send it to this number right here, if that works for you,"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yeah, that's fine. This is my cell so I'll see it. Just make sure you include your name and company in the text so I know what it's for. I get a lot of random messages. Anything else you need from me right now or are we good?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "That's all. Thank you for your time. Sarah looking forward to working together."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Alright, sounds good. I'll keep an eye out for that link. Have a good one."
