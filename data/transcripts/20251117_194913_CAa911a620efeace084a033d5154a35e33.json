      "content": "Elite Auto Spa, this is Sarah speaking. How can I help you?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hey Sarah, how are you doing today?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I'm doing alright, pretty busy day here at the shop. What can I do for you?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I just want to ask you a quick question, Sarah. How do you guys handle your your customer relations?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "We mostly handle it through texts, phone calls, and emails right now. It works but honestly it can be a bit all over the place - sometimes things fall through the cracks. Why do you ask?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "While I've been working with some other auto detailing shops, setting up a lead, nurturing chatbot for them. Um, so basically, this system takes any time a customer submits a form online, generates a personal conversation with them 4 to 5 exchanges, and then qualifies them to hand off, to whoever your lead salesperson is whether that's yourself or someone else in the company.  Um, does that like some sound like something you guys would be interested in?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Hold on, so this is like an automated chatbot that talks to customers when they fill out a form on our website? I guess my first question is - how does it know what to say about our specific services? We do everything from basic details to full PPF installs, and the pricing and timeline varies a lot depending on the vehicle and what they need. Does it actually understand that kind of stuff or is it just generic responses?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yeah, so it actually does understand those details and I'll ask you um something else. Have you worked with chat gbt at all Sarah."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yeah, I've played around with it a little bit - used it to write some job postings and customer emails. I get the general idea. So you're saying this uses that kind of technology to have actual conversations about our services? I'm curious how you'd train it to know the difference between like a ceramic coating job versus a full PPF wrap - those are totally different price points and timelines."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yeah for sure. So it does use chat gbt in the background but what I can do is I can give it a series of instructions, that tells it about how to behave information, about your store, preferences for how you like it to act all of your services. And so that way whenever it interacts with customers, it has the entire background customized just for you guys. So for instance the other company I was working with. We had about a 4,000 that I gave this chat gbt to use interactive customers so we can customize it for whatever your needs and services are"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Okay, that makes more sense. So you basically program it with all our info upfront. I'm assuming this would live on our website then? Here's the thing though - most of our customers actually just text or call us directly. We get some web forms but honestly it's maybe 20 or 30 percent of our leads. The rest are people texting the shop number or calling after seeing us on Instagram or getting a referral. Would this help with any of that or is it just for website inquiries?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yeah. So I could actually absolutely set it up to uh, respond to texts. Coming to you guys uh, at the shop instead of website forms that was the main traffic for the other company. I worked with, but it, like I said, we can customize this for your needs and your situation and having those responses for the actual company, number shouldn't be an issue to implement."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Huh, okay that's interesting. So it would actually respond to people texting our main shop number? I'll be honest, that makes me a little nervous - we get a lot of repeat customers who text us directly, and I'd hate for them to feel like they're talking to a robot instead of us. How does it handle that? Like if Mrs. Johnson texts asking when she can bring her Range Rover back in, would it know she's been here before or would it treat her like a new lead?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Let me ask you, do you guys use any sort of CRM?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Not really, no. We've got customer info scattered between our basic scheduling calendar, some spreadsheets, and honestly a lot of it is just in our heads or text message history. The owner keeps talking about getting a proper CRM but we haven't pulled the trigger on anything yet. Is that something this would tie into or replace?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yeah, totally understand those CRM monthly fees can be really high. Um so yeah I I can and have worked with spreadsheets. So even though not an official CRM, what I can do is I can automate a process where every time a customer contacts you, whether it's through a website or through organically, uh, on your personal number, I can make that populate spreadsheet and then I can do checks, if the customers already existing, don't add them to its spreadsheet. So it basically build out a whole system, your customers their services, um, and this can be automated in addition with this process."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Okay, so it's building a database as it goes. That actually could be helpful since we don't have anything organized right now. But I'm still stuck on the customer experience piece - like if someone texts us and gets an automated response, are they gonna know it's a bot? Because our customers are pretty high-end, luxury car owners, and I feel like some of them might not love that. Also, what happens when the bot can't answer something or the customer wants to talk to a real person? Does it hand off to us at some point?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yeah, it does. So this bot is not here to replace any of you guys talking to the customers. The goal of this bot is to  Qualify the lead, get them talking be that first touch point, and then hand off to you guys. So I can basically program it to say, hey, you're allowed to answer questions. Kind of these general questions about the company. If anything gets technical, then hand off to a representative. Um, and the point you made about,  whether they'll know what the bot. You'd be surprised. I'll send you a link here soon, um, so you can have a conversation with it and it's pretty human-like. I mean, maybe some people will be able to tell us about, it's not perfect. Um, but I'll also always have the option in text messages for them. If they reply stop, then it stops sending the messages. So there's always going to be the opt out option for any humans. Interacting"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Alright, I appreciate that there's an opt-out. And yeah, I'd be curious to see an example of how it actually talks to people. I guess my next question is what's this gonna cost us? Like I said, we're a small shop - 12 people, and we're not rolling in extra budget here. What kind of monthly fee are we talking about, and is there a setup cost to get all this programmed with our info?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I tell you what, I don't want to take up too much, more of your time today, you sound busy but what I can do is I can send you a link uh, to my calendar and a a time whenever you have a little bit more time, we could schedule a free sort of audit of your business to assess what your biggest needs are. And then I can better have a better idea of what we could Implement and budget. How does that sound?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yeah, I mean I'd need to see some more details before I commit to anything anyway. And honestly, I'd probably need to loop the owner in at some point since he makes the final call on spending. What does this audit involve - like how much time are we talking, and would it be a phone call or would you need to come by the shop?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "So I typically do them through video calls and they last  around 30 minutes."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Okay, 30 minutes on a video call I can probably swing. I'll be honest though, our owner is pretty hands-on so even if I like what I see, he'll need to be part of the conversation before we move forward with anything. Can you send me that calendar link? I'll take a look and see when I've got some time. Also, just so I know what to expect - are you gonna want me to have certain info ready for that call, like our current lead volume or anything like that?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yeah, absolutely. With the owner of time, I'm in um whatever info you have related to leads would be great. Uh if if you don't have specific details then we can work with that. But obviously, the more information you give to me, um, the better estimate. I'm giving it to make for how we're going to work together."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Alright, that's fair. I can probably pull together some rough numbers on how many inquiries we get per week and where they're coming from. I'll look for your calendar link and try to find a time that works. Just to be clear though - this audit is free, no strings attached, right? I'm not signing up for anything just by taking the call?"
